    "<think>\n嗯，用户问的是房东拖欠维修义务时，租客能采取哪些法律措施。这个问题确实挺常见的，但需要仔细梳理。首先得回忆一下中国的相关法律，主要是《民法典》里的租赁合同部分。记得第七百零八条到七百一十三条应该涉及维修责任。\n\n接下来要确定维修义务的范围。哪些情况属于房东必须负责的？比如房屋结构问题、自然老化导致的漏水，或者影响基本居住的设施故障。但如果是租客自己使用不当造成的，比如打碎玻璃，那可能就得租客自己修了。这点需要分清楚，不然容易误导用户。\n\n然后想到租客的应对步骤。通常第一步应该是通知房东，保留证据。比如书面通知，微信记录之类的。如果房东不回复或者拒绝，租客可能需要自己找人维修，但费用怎么处理？这时候可能需要垫付，但事后向房东追偿。不过如果租客没通知就直接修，房东可能会说没必要，所以通知步骤很重要。\n\n再考虑法律措施的具体内容。比如租客能不能自己维修？费用谁出？如果房东不付，租客能不能起诉？这时候要想到《民法典》第七百一十三条，里面提到如果房东不维修，影响居住的，租客可以自行维修，费用由房东承担。但必须是\"影响正常居住\"的情况，比如漏水导致没法住，或者暖气坏了。\n\n另外，租客可能需要收集证据。比如房屋照片、维修记录、沟通截图。这些在打官司的时候都是关键。特别是如果租客自己修了，得有发票证明费用，不然房东可能不认。\n\n还要注意一些细节。比如维修通知必须书面，口头可能不好举证。另外，租客不能因为房东不修就随便损坏房屋，否则可能要赔偿。还有，如果房屋有安全隐患，比如电线老化，租客可能有义务及时报告，避免事故。\n\n然后想到诉讼的可能性。如果租客垫付了维修费，或者房屋没法住，租客可以起诉要求房东支付费用或者赔偿损失。这时候需要明确诉讼请求，比如追偿维修费，或者解除合同并要求赔偿。但解除合同的条件比较严格，得是\"严重影响正常居住使用\"，比如整个房子断水断电。\n\n可能还要提醒用户避免常见错误。比如租客直接换掉房东的物品，或者破坏房屋结构，这样反而要承担责任。另外，有些地方可能有特别规定，",
    "<think>\nOkay, the user is asking about the standard for granting a preliminary injunction. Let me start by recalling the key elements from legal sources. First, I remember that preliminary injunctions are temporary measures, not final. They're used to prevent immediate harm before trial. \n\nThe user might be a student or someone dealing with a legal issue. They probably need a clear, structured explanation. But why are they asking? Maybe they're preparing for an exam, handling a case, or just curious. I should cover both the procedural steps and the substantive criteria.\n\nI need to mention the three main standards: substantial likelihood of success, irreparable损害, and reversible情况进行. Each is crucial. Substantial likelihood includes the legal arguments, evidence, and facts. Irreparable damage should explain how it's different from financial loss—like reputation or continued harm. Reversible situation is about the balance between harm and the risk of trial.\n\nWait, the user might confuse preliminary with permanent injunctions. I should clarify that preliminary is temporary. Also, emphasize that the judge isn't ruling on facts but on the probabilities. The user might not realize that the hearing is separate from the trial.\n\nI should check if there are different jurisdictions. The U.S. standards are similar but might vary. The user didn't specify, so I'll stick to general principles. Mentioning the衡ish principle is important—balancing both sides.\n\nAlso, the user might not know about the procedural steps: the motion must be timely, the judge needs jurisdiction, and there's a hearing. Including those adds context.\n\nI wonder if the user is in a hurry. They asked for an explanation, not just a list. So breaking it down with each standard's purpose and elements is key. Highlighting how法官 weighs each factor will help.\n\nMake sure to avoid jargon where possible, but some legal terms are necessary. Define terms like irreparable or reversible. Check sources like legal treatises to confirm accuracy.\n\nFinally, summarize the importance of the standards to prevent滥用 and protect合法权益. That ties it all together for the user's understanding.\n</think>\nGranting a **preliminary injunction** (or \"temporary restraining order,\" TRO) is a *temporary* court order, not a final judgment. Its primary purpose is to **prevent immediate, severe harm** before a trial can occur, allowing both parties time to resolve the dispute. The standard for granting such an order is based on **three interrelated but distinct factors** (primarily in common law jurisdictions like the US,",
    "<think>\nOkay, the user is asking about when corporate veil piercing can be justified. Let me start by recalling the basics. Corporate veil means the company's law is separate from its owners. But under certain circumstances, courts can merge them, letting shareholders be held liable for company debts.\n\nFirst, I need to list the key scenarios. The user mentioned \"circumstances,\" so I should focus on legal guidelines. I remember the姐妹 test from US law, where if姐妹 control the company and use it for personal gain, their liability might extend. Also,揭开 the corporate veil in piercing debt agreements—like when parties structure deals with the company to avoid personal liability.\n\nWait, the user is probably a law student or professional. They might need this for an exam or实务. Their deeper need could be understanding how courts apply these principles, not just memorizing. So I should explain the reasoning behind each case, not just the outcomes.\n\nI should also consider the ethical aspects. Like, when does the veil be揭开? That ties into fairness and protection of creditors. For example, if a company is used to逃避 taxes, that's a red flag. The user might be interested in how courts weigh these factors.\n\nAnother point: asset混同. If the company and its owners have the same money, that's a sign the veil should be揭开. But how to prove that? Evidence like bank records showing cross棕色 motion.\n\nAlso, the piercing of the veil for liability. Like when a shareholder sets up a company to get around personal liability. But what's the threshold? Some states require the company to be a mere vehicle for the shareholder's intent.\n\nI need to check if there are common misconceptions. For example, some think piercing is automatic. But it's a court decision based on evidence. The user might confuse this with administrative penalties, so clarifying the legal process is important.\n\nThe user's identity: likely a law student preparing for bar exams. They want a clear, structured answer with key principles. But they might also need examples to grasp concepts. Including hypothetical cases could help.\n\nAlso, the ethical dimension. The揭开 of the veil isn't about punishment but ensuring fair treatment. If shareholders use the company to harm creditors, liability isn't justified. So emphasizing that in the conclusion.\n\nI should structure the answer by scenario, explain why each applies, and mention the criteria like intent and evidence. Highlight that it's a last resort to prevent abuse of the legal system.\n\nMake sure to mention that in some jurisdictions, like the UK,",
    "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a summary of consumer rights under the EU's Digital Content Directive. Let me start by recalling the key components. The directive is part of the Digital Single Market, right? So it's about regulating online content for consumers.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the main sections. The user mentioned the directive, so I should refer to Article 23 to 30. Each article has specific rights. For example, Article 23 is about personal data. But I should check if there are other areas like fair dealing and advertising.\n\nWait, the user might be a student or professional needing this for academic or work. They probably need a concise overview without too much detail. But since they asked for summarizing, they might want key points highlighted. Maybe they're preparing a presentation or report.\n\nI should structure the summary by categories. Personal data protection is crucial. Then fair dealing, advertising rights, access to content, non-discrimination, and digital ecosystem rights. Each has sub-points. For instance, fair dealing involves price controls and right to comparison.\n\nAlso, mention enforcement mechanisms. The EU Commission enforces the directive. Highlighting that adds context. The user might not know about enforcement bodies, so including it is helpful.\n\nCheck if there are any recent developments. The directive was implemented in 2022. Maybe note that. But since the user didn't ask for timing, maybe just stick to the rights.\n\nMake sure not to miss any major rights. Fair dealing is important, as is non-discrimination for certain services. Also, access to content and digital ecosystem rights, like right to self-regulation.\n\nAvoid getting too technical. Keep explanations clear. For example, personal data requires consent and transparency. Fair dealing includes right to comparison and no price discrimination.\n\nDouble-check articles. Article 23 is personal data, 24 is advertising rights, 25 is access, 26 is non-discrimination, 27 is digital ecosystem rights. Got it.\n\nThe user might need this for compliance purposes. So emphasizing enforcement is key. Also, noting that the directive applies to digital content, which includes streaming, e-books, etc.\n\nEnsure all points are covered but not redundant. Maybe group similar rights. But for clarity, list each category with key sub-points. Conclude with the purpose: protecting consumers in a digital economy.</think>\nHere's a summary of the **EU Digital Content Directive (2022)** concerning consumer rights, covering the core areas mandated by Article 2",
    "<think>\n嗯，用户让我列举知识产权许可协议的常见风险。首先得确定用户是谁，可能是法律从业者、企业高管，或者创业者。用户需要这些信息可能是为了起草协议，或者评估现有协议的风险。\n\n接下来，得回忆知识产权许可的主要类型。常见的有专利、软件、商标、著作权的许可。每种类型的风险点可能不同，但用户要的是共同风险。需要分门别类，不能混在一起。\n\n然后想到核心风险。比如权利不明确，许可方可能自己都不清楚拥有哪些权利，这样许可的基础就垮了。还有许可范围的问题，太宽可能侵权，太窄又达不到目的。比如软件许可里用户协议说可以反向工程，但合同里又限制，这就矛盾了。\n\n再考虑违约条款。许可方可能设置模糊的条款，比如\"违反职业道德\"，这样在纠纷时很难界定。被许可方也可能忽略一些隐含义务，比如保密，导致泄密后无法追责。\n\n还有知识产权本身的问题。比如许可方的核心技术可能已经过时，或者被无效了，但协议还没调整。或者被许可方改进的技术归属不清，导致后续创新受阻。\n\n然后想到执行层面的问题。比如协议里规定要提供支持，但被许可方没响应，许可方却以此为由终止协议，缺乏明确标准。或者维权成本太高，小纠纷不值得打官司。\n\n还要考虑特殊风险。比如交叉许可里，如果被许可方没拿到足够的专利，可能影响业务。或者地域限制导致市场分割，但被许可方需要多区域销售。\n\n可能遗漏的点？比如协议期限到期后自动续约，被许可方习惯继续使用但没续签，变成侵权。或者许可费调整机制不明确，双方对通胀敏感但没约定公式。\n\n还要注意国际差异。比如不同国家专利要求不同，许可协议没考虑地域可能出问题。但用户可能更关注通用风险，暂时不提国际部分，除非有特别例子。\n\n最后得组织结构。分权利基础、范围、义务、违约、知识产权状态、改进技术、执行、终止这些大类。每个类下举具体风险，比如权利不明确包括权属不清、权利受限、范围模糊等。\n\n需要检查是否有重复。比如\"许可范围\"和\"权利范围\"可能重叠，但最好细分。还有\"隐含义务\"和\"违约条款\"的关系，许可方可能通过违约条款加入未写明的义务。\n\n可能"
