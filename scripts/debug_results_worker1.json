    "<think>\n嗯，用户让我列出公司股东在股东大会上的投票权限制。首先，我需要确认用户的具体需求是什么。可能用户是股东，或者公司管理人员，想了解投票时的限制情况。不过问题有点宽泛，因为投票权限制在不同公司类型、不同国家可能差别很大。\n\n首先，我应该回忆一下常见的投票权限制类型。比如，表决权是否受经济能力限制？比如有些公司会要求股东证明自己有足够资金才能投票，但这种情况好像不太普遍。可能更多是在特定国家的法律里存在，比如美国某些州可能有类似规定，但联邦层面好像没有。\n\n然后想到，公司章程或者股东协议可能对投票权有额外限制。比如一票否决权，某些股东可以阻止特定决议通过。或者优先股股东在特定事项上有更高表决权。这些属于协议层面的限制，而不是法律强制的。\n\n接下来，公司法层面的规定。比如有些国家允许公司通过章程限制表决权，比如小股东必须联合才能投票，或者按持股比例行使表决权但设置最低门槛。比如英国的《公司法》2006》第30条，允许章程规定表决权行使的条件，比如需要一定比例的净资产。不过这些限制通常针对新股东或特定事项，而不是日常投票。\n\n还要考虑优先股的情况。优先股通常在分红、清算时有优先权，但表决权可能受限，比如不能参与公司日常经营的决议，只能对股息相关事项投票。这时候表决权是受经济权利类型的限制，而不是完全剥夺。\n\n另外，一票否决权的情况需要说明，这是股东之间的协议，不是法律强制，所以每个公司情况不同。比如创始人可能和某些股东约定在股权转让时有一票否决权，但这属于合同约束，不是投票权限制本身。\n\n然后想到，用户可能混淆了\"限制\"和\"排除\"。比如某些股东可能被排除在表决之外，比如未支付股款的股东，或者离职的高管股东。这时候是资格问题，而不是投票权本身的限制。需要区分清楚。\n\n还要注意不同国家的法律差异。比如美国特拉华州公司法比较灵活，允许章程规定表决权条件；而中国《公司法》对有限责任公司和股份有限公司的规定可能不同。用户没有指定国家，可能需要说明普遍情况，但也要指出可能存在地域差异。\n\n可能用户实际遇到的问题是某个股东无法有效行使表决权，比如公司设置了较高的参会门槛",
    "<think>\nOkay, the user is asking about the legal test for determining negligence in tort law. This is a fundamental concept in civil law, so I need to be precise. \n\nHmm, the user used \"法治\" in the query but specified \"tort law\" - probably a typo for \"tort\". I should correct that gently in my response to avoid confusion. \n\nThe user seems academically inclined - maybe a law student or professional preparing for exams. They didn't ask for examples, but including one would help solidify the concept. The phrase \"think deeply\" suggests they want thoroughness, not just bullet points. \n\nI recall negligence has three core test components: duty, breach, and causation. But I must clarify that \"duty\" isn't always obvious - like in cases where people aren't legally bound by others. Should mention that duty can extend to others despite no prior relationship. \n\nOh! The causation test is where things get messy with \"but for\" and \"proximate cause\". Better explain how courts weight scientific evidence versus contextual factors. \n\nWait - should I distinguish civil negligence from criminal negligence? The user didn't ask, but it's a common point of confusion. Maybe just a brief note since they specifically asked for \"tort law\". \n\nThe user's phrasing (\"legal test\") makes me think they want the formal framework. I'll structure it as: 1) duty requirement 2) breach of duty 3) causation. Then add the exception about limitations of care. \n\n...Double-checking if I'm missing anything. The \"proximate cause\" part is crucial - that's where the law of unreasonableeness comes in. Must include that. \n\nI feel like including a concrete example (like a driver ignoring warnings) would make it stick better. But since the user didn't ask for examples, maybe just as footnote. \n\n*mental note* Avoid jargon where possible. Even if they're professionals, clarity is key. Define terms like \"proximate cause\" when first used. \n\nThe tone should be authoritative but not condescending. They said \"describe\" so it's descriptive, not argumentative. \n\n...Did I cover all three elements? Duty: special relationship or reasonable care. Breach: failure to meet duty. Causation: actual + proximate. Yes. \n\nShould I mention that negligence is often the default test in cases where other fault is proven? Like in产品质量 liability. Maybe briefly - it shows relevance beyond textbook definition. \n\n",
    "<think>\nOkay, the user wants me to compare mediation and arbitration in terms of enforceability. Let me start by recalling the basic differences between these conflict resolution methods. \n\nMediation is where a neutral third party helps the parties talk through their issues. The goal is to reach a mutually agreeable solution. I remember that in mediation, if the parties sign a settlement agreement, that document can be enforced like any other contract. But mediation itself isn't binding. So the enforceability here is only on the agreement, not the process.\n\nArbitration is different. The parties choose a neutral person (or panel) to裁断 the dispute. Once the arbit庭 issues a decision, that's binding. The enforceability comes from the arbit庭's order, which can be enforced through court. But the arbit庭's power is limited to what they裁, so they can't impose further remedies. \n\nWait, the user specifically asked about enforceability. So I need to focus on how each method results in binding forces. For mediation, the binding part is the settlement agreement. For arbitration, it's the arbit庭's award. \n\nI should also consider why the user might be asking this. Maybe they're working on a legal document, dealing with a dispute, or studying conflict resolution. They might need to understand which method to choose for enforceability. For example, if they want a solution to be legally binding without a court, mediation might be better. But if they need a strong, court-enforced award, arbitration is the way. \n\nAlso, the user mentioned \"user\" in the query, but that seems like a typo. Maybe they meant \"the user.\" Anyway, the main task is the comparison. I need to make sure the points are clear and cover both mechanisms. \n\nLet me check if there are nuances. In mediation, the parties might still fight after the third party leaves, but once they sign the agreement, it's binding. In arbitration, even if the parties later agree, the award is still binding unless there's an appeal. But the standard仲裁判 is final. \n\nI should also mention the strengths and weaknesses. For example, mediation is faster and less costly, but enforcement relies on the agreement. Arbitration is more formal and has stronger enforcement, but it's slower and involves costs. \n\nThe user might not know the difference between a mediation agreement and an arbitration award. Clarifying that could be helpful. Also, emphasizing that mediation doesn't create a court order, while arbitration does. \n\nI need to structure",
    "<think>\nOkay, the user is asking about the reporting obligations under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). Let me start by recalling the basics of FCPA. It's a U.S. law that prohibits companies from offering or收受 foreign money to influence foreign officials. The reporting obligations are part of this enforcement mechanism.\n\nFirst, I need to distinguish between the reporting obligations for companies and those for individuals. Companies are primarily responsible for reporting under Section 882 of the FCPA. They have to file Form 882 monthly, provide detailed information about their activities, and submit certain documents like receipts to foreign officials. If a company is found violating FCPA, they might face penalties like fines or criminal charges.\n\nThen there's the individual aspect. Individuals like foreign officials or their agents might report violations to the SEC. The SEC has the authority to investigate and report to the司法 department. So, reporting obligations here involve individuals submitting information to the SEC, which then leads to investigation.\n\nWait, the user might be confused between reporting obligations for companies and individuals. I should clarify that. Companies have monthly reporting requirements, while individuals report to the SEC. Also, the user might not know that reporting to the SEC is part of the process, not a standalone obligation.\n\nI should check if there are any nuances. For example, the SEC's reporting to Congress is under Section 78c of the证券交易 Act. That's different from the FCPA reporting. The user might be mixing these up. Need to make sure not to conflate the two reporting structures.\n\nAlso, the user's identity is important. They could be a company compliance officer looking to avoid penalties, or a legal student studying FCPA. Since they asked about reporting obligations, they probably need practical info on their responsibilities or how to navigate the reporting process.\n\nDeep needs: They might want to know how to prevent violations, or what steps to take if they're涉嫌 FCPA violations. The reporting obligations are a key part of enforcement, so understanding their implications is crucial. They might be concerned about non-compliance leading to heavy penalties, so emphasizing the importance of proper reporting and documentation is key.\n\nI should structure the answer to cover both company and individual reporting obligations, explain the reporting requirements for each, and note the differences. Highlight the monthly reporting for companies and the SEC submission for individuals. Also, mention the penalties associated with non-reporting, as that's a direct consequence.\n\nNeed to avoid jargon but still be precise. Terms like Form ",
    "<think>\nOkay, the user wants me to explain \"force majeure\" and give three examples. Let me start by recalling what force majeure means. It's an免责 clause in contracts where parties aren't responsible for disruptions due to unexpected or extraordinary forces. But I need to make sure I get the definition right.\n\nHmm, the user mentioned \"Explain the concept\" and then \"give three examples.\" So I should structure the answer with a clear definition first, then the examples. But why would the user ask this? Maybe they're studying contract law, working on a project, or just curious. Since they specified \"user,\" they might be an academic or professional needing this info. I should keep it precise but accessible.\n\nWait, force majeure is often used in shipping, insurance, or construction contracts. The examples should cover different sectors. Let me think of three solid examples. For shipping, the天津 to New York disaster comes to mind. That was a massive storm with no warning, affecting the Sura to天津 route. That fits. Then, the 2011 Japan earthquake in insurance. That's a classic example where force majeure免责. Finally, a construction one. The 2008 California earthquake damaged infrastructure. That's a good example too.\n\nI need to make sure each example clearly states the force and how it's force majeure. Also, the user might want to know the purpose of force majeure. So explaining why it's used—like avoiding liability for unforeseen events—would add value. But the main focus is the concept and examples. \n\nIs there a deeper need here? Maybe the user is preparing for an exam, writing a paper, or needing practical examples for a project. By providing clear examples, I'm helping them apply the concept. They might also want to understand how force majeure differs from other免责 clauses, but the question doesn't ask for that, so maybe skip unless necessary.\n\nI should check if the examples are accurate.天津 to NY disaster: yes, it was a force majeure incident. Japan earthquake: standard example. California construction: also correct. Need to mention that force majeure is an \"exceeding the ordinary\" force, not just any disaster. Emphasize that it's unforeseen or extraordinary.\n\nAlso, in the conclusion, restate the key points: definition, purpose, examples. Make sure the examples are distinct and cover different scenarios. Avoid overlapping events.天津 and Japan are separate"
